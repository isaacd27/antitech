- Touch controls (never done it before, need help)
- Shooting mechanic
- Debug lives system
- New hazards at 5000m (Current hazard system picks randomly)
- New themes every so often (when to switch themes?)
- Rework Hazard system, possibly (Current hazard system is A. Buggy and B. only accounts for full wall obstacles)
